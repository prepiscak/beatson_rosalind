    "- **Notebooks make it easy to record and reproduce data analysis steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "Insights in biomedical research require data analysis, but complex analysis is hard to document, share and reproduce. Notebooks enable researchers to quickly develop a rich scientific document that conducts an analysis, shows the results, and explains scientific context. Each code cell of a notebook executes commands to manipulate and explore your data. Code cells can be written in Python, R, or other languages already familiar to the researcher. It is straightforward to expand the functionality of the source code by installing pre-existing libraries, packages or modules of code in a variety of languages. Markdown cells contain formatted explanatory text, links, and images to compliment code cells. Better than \"notes\", Julyter notebooks mean you will never have questions you can't answer because you forgot your exact analysis steps from eight years ago.\n",
    " \n",
    "The notebook's linear structure records each step you take in order. When shared, someone else can see how you manipulated the data and can execute the cells in order to reproduce your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **They enable interactive analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you “run” a code cell, output displays right away in a new cell directly underneath the original cell. Working in a notebook, it is possible to run an analysis, observe the result, then change the parameters and re-run the analysis step by step, in real time. \n",
    " \n",
    "- **Notebooks extend the information content of published articles**\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, researchers can lend detail about how they derived their results and make it easy for others to reproduce or replicate their analysis by publishing notebooks as an addendum to a traditional publication. Traditional scientific journals can only capture so much detail. Most of the critical data analytics process is under-the-hood, and missing from a summary section. Seeing and executing the actual code tells so much more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further, when others query your notebook, they can poke around, and even build on your findings. They can easily access your methods and apply them to other populations.  \n",
    " \n",
    "- **They make collaborating and sharing seamless**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Notebooks are easy to share, and self-contained, collaborating and sharing work in process and reults is a simple matter of sharing a workspace. \n"
